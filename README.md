# props
* **stringArray (required):**
  It is the list of elements you want to render. It must has to be provided to the component as an **Array of Strings** type.
* **delayTime (required):**
  It is the time gap **(in seconds)** you want to put between each blink. It is also a required prop. It has to be a float type.
* **random (optional):**
  It is an optional property which defines if you want the elements to change in random order or not while blinking. It is a boolean type.
  random = {true} => renders the elements in random order than the order they are provided in the stringArray
  random = {false} => renders the elements in same order they are provided in the stringArray
* **className (optional):**
  This defines the styles of the elements such as color, size, strokes, etc.
